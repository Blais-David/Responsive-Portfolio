                    <p class="lead">I am a Minnesota native that graduated from Metropolitan State University with a BA
                        in film
                        studies with a complete focus on Screenwriting. I moved to Atlanta, GA for the film work and
                        after not
                        making any headway, I moved my focus towards computer programming at a Georgia Tech University
                        Bootcamp
                        to make a career change.</p>

                        <p>I am a huge fan of media; I enjoy films, video games, and books that tell very creative and
                        fulfilling
                        stories that are well thought out and well executed. From living in Minnesota, I do enjoy
                        snowboarding,
                        but there isn't much opportunity for me to use that skill in Georgia.</p>

                        <p>All in all, I'm pretty easy to get along with and I always enjoy making new friends!</p>
